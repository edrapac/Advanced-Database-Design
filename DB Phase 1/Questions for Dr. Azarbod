Questions for Dr. Azarbod

So do start and end date for both employee and sale time have a start date field and an end date field? if so how do we handle "ongoing" conditions like current job or a current sale, is the end date value null then? Intentionally going to store a null value

Start and end dates of sales will always be known, check with sysdate to see if it is still ongoing

Discount - create table with ID's that correspond to discounts, 
we need to decide if we want to base it off of membership time or during sales or customer loyalty

What type of date format is best for the test to use?
oracle format 
dd-MON-yyyy - Dec
