Only one employee can help per order, however each employee may make many sales

To query for a date range of commission we will simply sum the date_created field of Customer_Order that is associated with Employee and make sure that it is in the correct range as well as is then multiplied by the employee's commission percentage.

Commission as well as any kind of discount will be stored as a decimal ie 0.05 to represent 5% and it will be multiplied against any gross sum to create a final number

We dont need a relationship with the discount table, to find if an item gets a discount we select it's date_created and then query the Discount table saying select discount_ID where date_created >= Discount.Start Date and <= Discount.End Date 

States will be constrained to uppercase 2 letter abbreviations


Added gender to customer (use alter)

Changed State to an FK on Customer (ask Dr. Azarbod about this one)

REGION PK is State and Region_ID

addded CONSTRAINT UNIQUE_STATE UNIQUE ("State") to Customer because state is not a Primary key but it is referenced as a foreign key in the REGION Table

Fixed the date / time formatting by editing the insert statements 

Column naming structure is as follows: if it is more than one word ie first name, it is capitalized first word undercase lowercase ie First_name
If it is 2 words and one is an acronym the acronym is all caps ie Employee_ID
If it is only 1 word the word is caps ie Width
Constraints are all uppercase and will be incremented ie EMPLOYEE_PK1 EMPLOYEE_PK2 etc

States do not cross time zones, regions do not cross the timezone line ie Indiana is fully within the CT region
