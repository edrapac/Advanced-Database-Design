## Object Oriented Database Programming

### Basic Outline

We want to first define our Object-Types, this can first be done by identifying which types of fields can be consolidated and best rolled into a single "Object" a good example would be something like an Address Object, which would be an aggregate of street address, city, state, country, postal code etc.

After we define our Object Types we then create our Tables, as the Tables will hold the Objects, so populating your Objects must happen before you populate your Tables.
